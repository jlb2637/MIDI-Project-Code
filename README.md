# MIDI-Project-Code
The Code to run on an Arduino Micro for my custom MIDI controller project

A summary of the project:
I have a grid of 30 buttons (5x6) and 3 potentiometers(2 knobs, 1 slider) fitted to a 3d printed enclosure able to send MIDI signals over a serial connection to a digital audio workstation(DAW) on a pc. I'm running all of my digital data through an arduino micro to be sent to a PC via serial cable(I want to cut this out in future versions with a more custom solution). As you could imagine, a small arduino does not have 30 digital pins so! I designed a custom parallel-in serial-out shift register PCB so I am only using a single digital I/O pin on the arduino. Currently progress is slow as college takes up quite a bit of time! As of right now, all of the buttons are are to function as MIDI inputs through the custom shift register board and arduino. Next steps are to finish designing and 3d printing the bottom of the enclosure and fit all the potentiometers in place, then finish the software for them.
