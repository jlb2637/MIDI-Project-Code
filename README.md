# MIDI-Project-Code
The Code to run on an Arduino Micro for my custom MIDI controller project

A summary of the project:
I have a grid of 30 buttons (5x6) and 3 potentiometers(2 knobs, 1 slider) fitted to a 3d printed enclosure able to send MIDI signals over a serial connection to a digital audio workstation(DAW) on a pc. I'm running all of my digital data through an arduino micro to be sent to a PC via serial cable(I want to cut this out in future versions with a more custom solution). As you could imagine, a small arduino does not have 30 digital pins so! I designed a custom parallel-in serial-out shift register PCB so I am only using a single digital I/O pin on the arduino. Currently progress is slow as college takes up quite a bit of time! 

# early april update

The assembly is 'pretty' much done! besides all of the analog inputs, everything is in the enclosure and working! I'll add a video to this page soon, I need to work on the software more.
